#Graphical Models for Identifying Pore-forming Proteins
This repository provides codes for paper *Nan Xu, Theodore W. Kahn, Theju Jacob, Yan Liu, Graphical Models for Identifying Pore-forming Protein*.

The below commands assume we are at location: `./project_package`.
## Requirements

This code package was tested with `python 3.7.3` on Linux. For other library dependencies, you can
1. First install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) 
1. Refer to `environment.yaml` and install in terminal with Anaconda: 
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    ```
1. Download the UniProt20 database from the following link (around 12G, takes about 30m to download):
    ```
    http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/hhsuite/databases/hhsuite_dbs/old-releases/uniprot20_2016_02.tgz
    ```
   1. uncompress zip file
   1. rename the folder to `uniprot20_2016_02`, ensure all files in this folder except `md5sum` have prefix `uniprot20_2016_02`
   1. move the folder to `packages/TGT_Package/databases`
  

## Run Experiment
1. Activate the environment:

    ```
    conda activate SCRFs
    ```
1. Change parameters in config.py
    
    The table below provides an overview of the parameters:

1. run main.py and log stdout to log.txt
    ```
    python main.py >> logThe below commands assume we are at location: `./project_package`.
## Requirements

This code package was tested with `python 3.7.3` on Linux. For other library dependencies, you can
1. First install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) 
1. Refer to `environment.yaml` and install in terminal with Anaconda: 
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    ```
1. Download the UniProt20 database from the following link (around 12G, takes about 30m to download):
    ```
    http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/hhsuite/databases/hhsuite_dbs/old-releases/uniprot20_2016_02.tgz
    ```
   1. uncompress zip file
   1. rename the folder to `uniprot20_2016_02`, ensure all files in this folder except `md5sum` have prefix `uniprot20_2016_02`
   1. move the folder to `packages/TGT_Package/databases`
  

## Run Experiment
1. Activate the environment:

    ```
    conda activate SCRFs
    ```
1. Change parameters in config.py
    
    The table below provides an overview of the parameters:

## Toy Results
The fasta file `records/records_20201219/Crickmore_CryProteins.txt` is split into 10 files ending with `.fasta`. If we use the default parameters, i.e., the `config.py` is not modified, we are expecting to have results in `records/2021-01-xx-xx-xx-xx` (the folder with latest date)
1. group summaries: `records/2021-01-07-14-21-31/filtering/group_1_summary.csv`, proteins in each file sorted by `SCRFs Score`. No testing proteins are predicted to have similar structure as PFTs in `group 2` and `group 3`. Take the `group_1_summary.csv` as an example:

    |   | ID       | PFT Probability    | SCRFs Score | Sequence  |
    |---|----------|--------------------|-------------|-----------|
    | 0 | Cry21Ga1 | 0.9998382329940796 | 3.79        | MADLSN... |
    | 1 | Cry32Ga1 | 0.9999923706054688 | 2.73        | MYQNYN... |
1. dataset summaries: `records/2021-01-07-14-21-31/filtering/dataset_summary.csv` with proteins sorted by  `PFT Probability`. The summary file looks as follows:

    |   | ID       | PFT Probability    | Sequence  |
    |---|----------|--------------------|-----------|
    | 0 | Cry32Ga1 | 0.9999923706054688 | MYQNYN... |
    | 1 | Cry21Ga1 | 0.9998382329940796 | MADLSN... |
